# Project: “Take me someplace…” React Hackathon
A one day Hackathon solo project where I planned, designed and built a small front-end app, consuming a simple weather API.
Part of the Full-stack developer course at General Assembly.

Once in a while, we all want to be in a very different weather system than the one we're currently in. Where do you feel like going?

### Tools used: React, Axios, Node, Bulma, Git & GitHub, yarn.
