# Project two: React Hackathon

Once in a while, we all want to be in a very different weather system than the one we're currently in.
Where do you feel like gong?

## Overview
A quick front end **React** app built in one day, using **Axios**, **Bulma** and consuming a simple weather **API**, as post of the Full-stack developer course at General Assembly.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
