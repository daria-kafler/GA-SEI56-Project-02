//Here should have list of cities, in CitiesRandom.js will need to find a way to randomly select a city  
//according to user choice ('warm'/'cold') and pass it into the api url in either WarmPlace.js or CoolPlace.js

//I canâ€™t see a plan in the cities list file but that can definitely work. 
//You can just define an array of cities as strings in a normal const, not as state. 
//Then I would write some functionality that picks one of them randomly and either
// sets it to state or you can then make the api call straight after inside the same function and pass it in
